Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: Hexagons will be the rooms and halls, the tesselation will be the walls.

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: A helper method that will help generate shapes.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: Hallways are polygons and hallways are just narrow strips that connect rooms. They have a different pattern than walls.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: My implementation was different since I did not account for all cases where hexagons can be placed. I learned I should pay closer attention to corner cases.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: First, I check if a room overlaps another. If it does, don't place it. If a room placed is within a certain distance to another room, connect them with a hallway.

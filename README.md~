# My first game

I built this game in Spring 2019 Semester at UC Berkeley for the class CS 61B on data structures. This is a 2D game where the player controls his player to find locked doors to escape.  

##### Setup
Use IntelliJ or another IDE to import the included libraries needed to run this game.

#####How to play
Press 'n' to start a new game. You will be prompted to enter a seed, so enter any random number and press 's' to save. This will automatically start the game.  
Use the WASD keys to move around until you find a yellow tile. Move onto the tile to win.
